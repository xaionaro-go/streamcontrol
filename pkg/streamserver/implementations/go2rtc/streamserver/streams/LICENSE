A remark by Dmitrii Okunev:

The initial code of this package (package `streams`) was copied from
repository https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc of revision
a4885c2c3abce58074d04878bba0d72105642a9b.

The content of the LICENSE file is attached above. I had to modify
the code (see the details in the paragraph below), and you are free
to use whatever license you like to use the modifications applied
to this package: CC-0, WTFPL-v2, MIT, or whatever else license.

The only reason I had to copy and modify this code, is because
a lot of packages (including `streams`) in `go2rtc` are shielded
from importing by Go tooling through placing them
in the `internal/` directory.
